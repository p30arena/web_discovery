1. Database Setup: Set up a PostgreSQL database to store profile data, assessment scores, product information, and agent progress. Define database tables with appropriate schemas for each data type.
2. Implement Profile Search: Use the Instagram's Graph API to search for profiles based on keywords, location, and posts. Store the search results in the database.
3. Develop Profile Assessment Agent: For each profile in the database, check the bio, posts, and post quality. Calculate scores based on the criteria in Overview.md. Store the assessment scores in the database.
4. Extract Product Information: Extract product information from the bio and posts during profile assessment. Store the extracted product information in the database.
5. Implement Pause/Resume Functionality: Add functionality to pause and resume the agents by tracking their progress in the database. Store the agent's state (e.g., last processed profile, current search query) in the database.
